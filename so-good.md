# So Good They Can't Ignore You (Cal Newport)

### Steps for crafting a fulfilling career:
- Master rare and valuable skills: adopt a craftsman mindset, and build deliberate practice into your routines to avoid a performance plateau
   - Deliberate practice = constantly stretching beyond your current comfort/ability level
   - Identify the fundamental skills / building blocks of success in your field, and tackle those with deliberate intensity
   - Be patient, and let good habits compound over time
   - Implementation ideas:
      - Track weekly hours spent on (1) hard to change, and (2) highly changeable, but important tasks (create a timesheet at the beginning of every week, and track progress)...become more intentional about how you spend your time
      - test
- Invest that "career capital" into obtaining rare and valuable job attributes: i.e., control, creativity/autonomy, and impact/mission
   - To identify your mission:
      - Build expertise, and get to the cutting edge of your field - look for ideas in the "adjacent possible"
      - Make "little bets" to generate concrete feedback
      - Make your mission remarkable - (1) must compel people to remark about it, and (2) must be launched in a conducive venue
         - You're either remarkable or invisible...A purple cow stands out
